## Why do you have experience in so many industries?

My current company, ThoughtWorks, is an American-based technology consulting company. We work on projects with different clients from various industries.

If you have read books about Clean Code, Refactoring, Test-Driven Development, and microservices, you may know Martin Fowler, who is one of the leaders at my company.

## Experience with AI?

I have experience using AI to assist with programming.

I have experience using Langchain, FastAPI, AWS OpenSearch, and AWS Bedrock to build LLM-related applications.

I don't have experience developing LLM models and algorithms.

## Current Salary and Expected Salary?

My current annual salary is 450万円 (before tax) in Japanese Yen.

My expected annual salary is 600万円 (before tax) in Japanese Yen.

I'm not someone who primarily expects a high salary. However, my current company provides me with good benefits:

-   Paid Annual Leave: 15 days per year.
-   Paid Sick Leave: 15 days per year.
-   Work From Home: I only need to go to the office fewer than 5 times per month.
-   Health Insurance: It covers all my family members.
-   No overtime: I work exactly 8 hours per day.

If the company could offer similar benefits, I would be open to accepting 450万円 annually (before tax) in Japanese Yen.

However, if not, considering the cost of living in Japan, I would expect 600万円 annually (before tax) in Japanese Yen.

## Job Preference?

Note: These are just preferences, not mandatory requirements.

-   A company that allows remote work, or a company not located in Tokyo.
-   A company that has more than 100 engineers as 正社員 (full-time employees).
-   A company that develops its own products, not a consulting/派遣 (dispatch/temporary staffing) service.
-   A company that emphasizes Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion.

I don't have a specific preference regarding company industry.

## Japanese/English Proficiency

I have passed JLPT N2.

If you are familiar with [CEFR](https://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chousa/koutou/091/gijiroku/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2018/07/27/1407616_003.pdf), here is my language proficiency according to CEFR:

## VISA?

I currently do not have a valid VISA to work in Japan. I require VISA sponsorship.

## Notice Period (When can you start work)?

I can start work as soon as possible. I understand that the VISA application process takes time. Before I obtain my VISA and can start working in Japan, I am available to work remotely as a 業務委託 (contractor/freelancer).
